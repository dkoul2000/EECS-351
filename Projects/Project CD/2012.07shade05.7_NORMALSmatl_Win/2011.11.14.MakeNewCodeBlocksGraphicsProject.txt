This directory already holds a complete, ready-to-use graphics project in CodeBlocks.  
To start, double-click the CodeBlocks Build Process (.cbp)' file.  
HOWEVER, I want each of you to know how to make your own:

===============================================
===============================================
     To Make Your Own Graphics Project
	with CodeBlocks, C++/OpenGL/freeGLUT
===============================================
===============================================

1)-Start CodeBlocks.  Near the center of the window that opens, 

2) click the 'Create a new project' link.

3)-This will open a dialog box. Click on:
	a)-- 'Console Application' icon in the top row of icons;
	b)-- 'C++' language selection (we won't use the C setting at all).
		Click 'Next'
	c)-- Enter your 'Project Title' (e.g. "Cube" or "ProjA" or...) and 
	d)-- Set the 'Folder to Create Project in' as desired,
	e)-- Keep the 'Project filename' default name (<Project Title>.cbp),
		**BUT**
	f)-- Check 'Resulting Filename' very carefully -- by default, the 
		CodeBlocks Wizard **DOES NOT** use the 'Folder to Create 
		Project in'!  Instead, it creates a sub-directory 
		<Project Title> to hold all project files, including the new 	
		<Project Title>.cpb file.
             If you don't want this new sub-directory, remove it from the path
		shown in 'Resulting Filename'.  
	g)-- Click 'Next' to see the compiler configuration page.
             Make no changes here:
		--use the (default) GNU GCC compiler; 
		--create 'debug' configuration, and
		--create 'release' configuration, and 
			use default directories for all.
	h)-- Clock 'finish'.  
		The wizard creates a 'skeleton' project, complete with a small
		'hello world' console program.

4)-Compile and run the default project made for you; be sure it works before you proceed.
	a)-- In CodeBlock's left-side window panel labeled 'Management', 
		click the 'Projects' tab.
	b)-- Double-click the colorful squares and <Project Name>.  
		It will open a 'Sources' folder.
		(if the 'Sources' folder isn't open, 
		 click the boxed '+' sign on its left side)
	c)-- Click on the filename 'main.cpp' shown.  
		It will open the default C++ file for your project.
	d)-- Above the 'Management' window panel you'll see a row of 
		yellow-and-green icons; click the 3rd one; 
		(a gear-and-green-arrow together)
		this will compile and run your program.  
	e)-- You should see a console window open where the program prints
		'Hell world', then a program-termination message  
		(e.g. 'Process returned 0 (0x0)   execution time : 0-.031 s'),
		and 'Press any key to continue'.

5)-Set Build Options to access the openGL and freeGLUT (or GLUT) libraries.	
	(I assume you installed these libraries on your machine; 
	 If not, see CodeBlocksGLUT-installNotes.txt).
	a)-- On the Menu bar at the top of your window, select this menu item:
		Project-->Build Options...
		to open the 'Project Build Options' pop-up dialog box.  
	b)-- In that box, the left-most panel shows a directory-like tree:
		<Project Name>
			+--Debug
			+--Release
		Click on <Project Name> at the top, 
			so that we set options for both Debug and Release.
	c)-- At the top of the pop-up dialog box, just below the 
		'Select Compiler' window, you'll find a row of tabs: 
	 	'Compiler Settings', 'Linker settings', 'Search directories'...
	    --Choose the 'Compiler Settings' tab, 
		within it, you'll find another row of tabs:
		'Compiler Flags', 'Other options', and '#defines'.
			--within 'Compiler Flags', click these checkboxes 
			  (plus any others you like):
				--'Produce debugging symbols [-g]
				--'In C mode, support all ISO C90 programs. In
				   C++ mode, remove GNU extensions that conflict
				   with ISO C++ [-ansi']
				--'Enable all compiler warnings (overrides many 
				   other settings) [-Wall]
			--within  '#defines' sub-tab, put this text:

				GLUT_DISABLE_ATEXIT_HACK
			(avoids an old and troublesome quirk in GLUT).
	    --Look up to the top row of tabs again, and 
	    --choose the 'linker settings' tab.
		within it, you'll see two large sub-windows.  The left one,
		'Link libraries', has 'add' 'edit' 'delete' and 'clear' buttons
		at the bottom. Use them to set these libraries:
			FOR WINDOWS:
		        	freeglut
				glu32
				opengl32
		
			FOR MacOS:   <nothing -- leave blank>
			FOR UBUNTU:

				GLEW
				glut
				GL
				GLU
	    --In the right window, put nothing for Windows and Ubuntu.
			FOR MacOS:
				-framework GLUT
				-framework OpenGL
				-framework Cocoa
		
	    --Once your 'Link Libraries' are correct, click 'OK' to close the
		'Project build options' dialog box.
			
6)-Put your C++ source file(s) in your named project directory, where you'll also find the <Project Name>.cbp file we created earlier.   If you don't have any C++ source files yet, use the 'glutPak.cpp' file supplied in the course starter-code.

7)-Set up the project to use the .cpp and .h files you put in the new project directory:
	a)--on the left side of the CodeBlocks window, in the 'Management' tile, under the 'Projects' tab, you'll see a colorful square icon with your Project's name. Right-click it, select 'Add files...' select the files (be sure you're only adding files from your project directory!), and click 'OK'.
	b)--click 'OK' on the pop-up dialog box that shows the files are part of both the 'debug' and the 'release' versions of the program.
	c)--On the left-side panel, 'Projects' tab, you should see an entry for every source-code file in your project.  Now you're ready to remove the skeleton program in 'main.cpp' file that contained 'hello world'.  Right-click on the 'main.cpp' filename shown, and select 'Remove file from project'.
You should also delete that file from your project directory.

8) You're ready! Save your project, then compile and run!
